I studied at the Panteion University of Athens in Greece ('Social and Political Sciences'), during 2009-2014. Specifically, I studied at the Department of Sociology, with specialisation in crime. After that, I also completed a 2-year study programme in journalism (2014-2016) at IEK Dafnis, Athens. I am always curious and passionate about how things work and always try to become a better version of my previous self. </p>

                            <div> During the above study programme, I have studied the origins and importance of sociology as well as the most important sociologists, their work and associated research. Examples in this area include Karl Marx and Max Weber. 
                                Emphasis was given to various important methods and techniques for examining various aspects and modern issues societies face. Special focus was given on the statistical methods needed to better understand and analyse data and patterns to answer some of the key social-oriented questions that can help society function more effectively. 
                                We have also analysed the theory behind social layering and foundations, also applied to modern societies.
                                Introduction was given to crime and its strong connection to sociology. Examination of the factors affecting this relationship was performed. This is an area that fascinated me and I decided to take more courses to enhance my knowledge.
                                Overall, completing my degree, I felt that I obtained a deeper understanding of society's foundation and its origins, of various issues modern societies face and the various methods used to analyse and attempt to solve these.

                            <div> Lessons in this degree programme focused mainly on the modern methods of research for journalism, as well as on publishing content mostly in a digital format. 
                                In paraller, attention was paid to the development of critical and analytical thinking, to the correct use of Greek language, as well as to the adherence of all rules comprising modern journalism's ethos.

                    <p>During my free time, I always ensure that I spend time exercising (with focus on weight lifting), as well as walking while listening to the music. I fondly believe in the relationship between mind and body. When my legs move, my thoughs move as well and I can think brightly. </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I have a passion for travelling. In this way, I can discover different cultures and enrich my communication skills. I always want to broaden my horizons and discover the various angles of art.</p>
                    <p>'Art should be something that liberates your soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go above and beyond.' (Keith Haring) </p>
