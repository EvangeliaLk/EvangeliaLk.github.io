I studied at the Panteion University of Athens in Greece ('Social and Political Sciences'), during 2009-2014. Specifically, I studied at the Department of Sociology, with specialisation in crime. After that, I also completed a 2-year study programme in journalism (2014-2016) at IEK Dafnis, Athens. I am always curious and passionate about how things work and always try to become a better version of my previous self. </p>

                                    <li>My main focus during my work experience at DPAM was on clothing for children of all ages.</li>
                                    <li>I have always been really helpful and kind in assisting customers either physically or by phone/email. I always paid attention to their needs and advised them on multiple clothing choices accordingly.</li>
                                    <li>Another task I was responsible for included preparing diligently our orders, which consists one of the main parts of the e-shop process. </li>
                                    <li>As my close colleagues used to say, <i>I have a stylistic eye for locating our kids' clothing cleverly, beautifully and purposefully throughout the whole shop.</i> </li>
                                    <li>Warehouse organisation was also one of my main responsibilities.</li>
                                    <li>Last but not least, I was successfully training all our new members, something I thoroughly enjoyed as I wanted them to have a smooth induction, enjoy their jobs and learn from my experience. </li>
                                    <li>The whole experience helped me enhance my planning and oragnisation skills, as during November 2022, I have successfully managed to set up running a new branch from scratch. </li>

                                    <li> Throughout my whole work experience at Pull & Bear, I have worked primarily for clothing for women and men, either at the Centre of Athens or at Glyfada's branch, with support at other branches when that was needed.</li>
                                    <li> Customer service (either physically or via phone/email) is something I have been really good at, always treating our customers with kindness and respect and putting them first. </li>
                                    <li> I massively helped during the process of setting up new branches. I also helped decorate with great style the front face for each one of our branches, with our newest arrivals.</li>
                                    <li> The decoration and set up of our branches was something I was really good at, and thoroughly enjoyed. </li>
                                    <li> Warehouse management with our new and existing orders was one of my main tasks, ensuring that efficient ways were in place for this purpose. </li>
                                    <li> I trained many new members of the team, helping them set up properly and answering all of their questions. I really enjoyed guiding them towards our well-established processes. </li>

                            <div> During the above study programme, I have studied the origins and importance of sociology as well as the most important sociologists, their work and associated research. Examples in this area include Karl Marx and Max Weber. 
                                Emphasis was given to various important methods and techniques for examining various aspects and modern issues societies face. Special focus was given on the statistical methods needed to better understand and analyse data and patterns to answer some of the key social-oriented questions that can help society function more effectively. 
                                We have also analysed the theory behind social layering and foundations, also applied to modern societies.
                                Introduction was given to crime and its strong connection to sociology. Examination of the factors affecting this relationship was performed. This is an area that fascinated me and I decided to take more courses to enhance my knowledge.
                                Overall, completing my degree, I felt that I obtained a deeper understanding of society's foundation and its origins, of various issues modern societies face and the various methods used to analyse and attempt to solve these.

                            <div> Lessons in this degree programme focused mainly on the modern methods of research for journalism, as well as on publishing content mostly in a digital format. 
                                In paraller, attention was paid to the development of critical and analytical thinking, to the correct use of Greek language, as well as to the adherence of all rules comprising modern journalism's ethos.

                    <p>During my free time, I always ensure that I spend time exercising (with focus on weight lifting), as well as walking while listening to the music. I fondly believe in the relationship between mind and body. When my legs move, my thoughs move as well and I can think brightly. </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">I have a passion for travelling. In this way, I can discover different cultures and enrich my communication skills. I always want to broaden my horizons and discover the various angles of art.</p>
                    <p>'Art should be something that liberates your soul, provokes the imagination and encourages people to go above and beyond.' (Keith Haring) </p>
